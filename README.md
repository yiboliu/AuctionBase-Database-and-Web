# AuctionBase-Database-and-Web
This is a project that takes data from eBay website stored in JSON format, converts load data into a SQLite Database via a python parser and removes duplicates. The web service enables users to manually change current time, search for auctions of interest via item id, category, description, price range and status. If the current time is before the starting time of the auction, then the status would be "Not Started"; if current time is after the open time, then the status would be "closed"; if the item has been bought by someone, then the status would be "closed" too; otherwise, the status would be "open". Users can only add bids on items in open auctions.
